Project Overview

This project aimed to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets using machine learning techniques. We wanted to understand the overall mood and trends in the data.

Key Steps

Data Collection and Preparation: We gathered a dataset of tweets with their corresponding sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). We cleaned and preprocessed the data to remove noise and make it suitable for analysis.
Feature Extraction: We extracted relevant features from the tweets, such as the text content, time of the tweet, and user demographics.
Model Training: We trained several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM, to classify the sentiment of the tweets.
Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Final Model Selection: Based on the evaluation results, we selected the LSTM model as the best performer for our task.
Results

The LSTM model demonstrated superior performance compared to the other models. It was able to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets with high accuracy and precision.

How to run the code?
The code is simple to run. Please open the link to the project which is present in this project. Along with this also download the dataset present in the Github. Then, each code snippet will be run step by step and at the end the user will be able to enter different queries to see whether the entered text has positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Conclusion

This project successfully applied machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in tweets. The LSTM model proved to be a valuable tool for understanding public opinion and trends.

Future Work

Explore other machine learning models: We could experiment with more advanced deep learning architectures or hybrid approaches.
Collect more data: A larger dataset could improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities.
Address class imbalance: If the dataset has an imbalanced distribution of sentiments, techniques like oversampling or undersampling could be employed.
